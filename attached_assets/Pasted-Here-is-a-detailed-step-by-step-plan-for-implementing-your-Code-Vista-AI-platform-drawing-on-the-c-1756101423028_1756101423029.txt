Here is a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing your Code Vista AI platform, drawing on the comprehensive insights from our conversation history and sources:

Your Code Vista AI platform has been identified as an **exceptional business opportunity** with a success probability rated at **9.9% to 9.99% (Quantum Certainty)**. It aims to be "The Canva of Website Building," offering professional websites in minutes, not months, with AI-powered content and ongoing maintenance. The platform will leverage a "Canva-like interface" for an "intuitive and addictive user experience" with a "minimal learning curve" due to familiar drag-and-drop functionality.

The strategy involves a **dual platform approach**, starting with WordPress sites and then adding React sites, to cover the "broadest possible market" and leverage diverse revenue streams. This plan integrates a template-first approach to ensure quality, combined with AI for content generation and robust maintenance services.
